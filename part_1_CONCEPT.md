Hi, </p>
After months of gaining knowledge, software skills and practice on smaller projects with courses and workshops,
now is time for my fully personal project on Data Analysis field. </p>

<b>INTRODUCTION:</b></p>
Winter is coming.
The air quality in my city has always been more then bad. This year we are all affraid it could be worse as the effect of inflation factors such as: expensive gas and other fuels(mosty coal), lower quality of fuel materials, social permission to incinerate garbage in boiler rooms and furnaces.
This is only opinion and intuitive predictions.
<b>MAIN CONSIDERATIONS:</b></p>
How strong are we allowed to suspect that effects of inflation might have negative impact for air quality? 
Speaking of possible deteriorating air quality: will there be a need to taking into concideration impact factors which are new for 2022 (such inflationon, city building development). Maybe detriorating (if occurs) will be natural for weather conditions which will occure?


<b>QUESTION TO ANSWEAR:</b> </p>
What (if any) are dpendencies beetween air pollution and weather condition in Krakow city, Poland. </p>
What are the trends of improvement/deterioration of air quality during last 5 years.</p>
What is the trend for 2022 in comparison to previous years, what role weather plays?</p>
And going further </p>
after analyzing weather role,


<b>Datasets</b> to analysis for years 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021
