Hi, </p>
After months of gaining knowledge, software skills and practice on smaller projects with courses and workshops,
now is time for my fully personal project on Data Analysis field.

![smog](https://github.com/weroau/krakow_air_pollution/blob/main/smogue.jpg?raw=true) 

<b>INTRODUCTION:</b></p>
Winter is coming.
The air quality in my city has always been more then bad. This year we are all affraid it could be worse as the effect of inflation factors such as: increase costs of fuels (mosty coal), lower quality of fuel materials, social permission to incinerate garbage in boiler rooms and furnaces.
This is only opinion and intuitive prediction.</p>
<b>MAIN CONSIDERATIONS:</b></p>
Speaking of possible deteriorating air quality: will there be a need to suspect factors which are new for 2022 (such inflation, city building development)
have negative impact for air quality?
Maybe deteriorating (if occurs) will be natural (seen before) for specific weather conditions?

<b>QUESTION TO ANSWEAR FOR ME:</b> </p>
What (if any) are dependencies between air pollution and weather condition in Krakow city, Poland. </p> What are the trends of improvement/deterioration of air quality during last 5 years.</p>
What is the trend for 2022 in comparison to previous years, what role weather plays?</p>

<b>DATASETS</b> to analysis for years 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021
1. Weather conditions (temperature, wind power and direction, humidity, pressure) public datasets from 
2. Air Pollution public datasets from Chief Inspectorate of Environmental Protection
</i>Bank danych pomiarowych - GIOÅš</i> 

<b>TOOLS:</b>
BigQuery(SQL), Tableau, Python?, Rstudio with R?</p>

Although  similar type of professional analysis has already been carried out by scientists from my former university, I am curious to what extent my analysis will cover the conclusions of scientists and what level of initiation can I achieve by working independently on publicly available data. Additionally I have a certain background of natural science knowledge (BEng. Environmental Protection) I would like to prepare convenient, interactive dashboards in Tableau.
